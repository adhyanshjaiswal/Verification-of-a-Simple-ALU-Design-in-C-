# Verification-of-a-Simple-ALU-Design-in-C-
This project implements and verifies a Simple ALU in C++. Users select operations like addition, subtraction, bitwise AND/OR, 1's/2's complements, and shifts. Arithmetic/logical results are in decimal; complements in binary. Modular design (alu.h, alu.cpp, testbench.cpp) enhances learning of ALU concepts, modular coding, and user interaction.
