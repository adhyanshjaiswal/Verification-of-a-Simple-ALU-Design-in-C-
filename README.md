# Simple ALU Design and Verification in C++

This project implements and verifies a **Simple Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)** in C++. The ALU supports a wide range of operations, including arithmetic, logical, and complement calculations, with an interactive user interface.

## üöÄ Features

### Supported Operations:
1. **Arithmetic Operations**  
   - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo  

2. **Logical Operations**  
   - AND, OR, XOR, NOT  

3. **Complement Calculations**  
   - 1's Complement (Binary Output)  
   - 2's Complement (Binary Output)  
   - 9's Complement (Binary Output)  
   - 10's Complement (Binary Output)  

4. **Bitwise Shifts**  
   - Left Shift  
   - Right Shift  

### Key Highlights:
- **Interactive Workflow:** The program lets users choose the operation before entering operands.  
- **Formatted Output:**  
  - Arithmetic/logical operations: Results displayed in decimal.  
  - Complement operations: Results displayed in binary.  
- **Modular Design:** Organized into separate files: `alu.h`, `alu.cpp`, and `testbench.cpp`.
